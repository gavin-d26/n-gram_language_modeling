# n-gram_language_modeling
Langauge modelling using n-gram models

To Run:

1) unzip the files into a new directory
2) cd into the unzipped directory
3) create a new environment using conda/venv and install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4) run the command: python scripts/task1.py

I would recommend running this script on the NLP server.
